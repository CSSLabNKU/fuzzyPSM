## fuzzyPSM
Code for our 2016 IEEE/IFIP DSN paper "fuzzyPSM: A New Password Strength Meter Using Fuzzy Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars"

**When users create a new account, most of them (77.38%) simply retrieve one of their existing passwords from memory and then reuse (or slightly modify) it.**

Based on this observation, we suggest a new password strength meter, named *fuzzyPSM*, that employs fuzzy probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG). 

This project comprises both Windows and Linux versions.
